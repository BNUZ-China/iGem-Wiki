        <h4>Laboratory safety</h4>
        <p>
          During the competition, we will conduct experiments in a biosafety level 1 laboratory. All the bacterial
          strain we use include Escherichia coli Nissle 1917（Biosafety Level 1）, E.coli DH5α（Biosafety Level 1）, E.coli
          BL21（Biosafety Level 1）, Clostridium sporogenes（Biosafety Level 2）, Bifidobacterium adolensentis（Biosafety
          Level 1） and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. （Biosafety Level 1），which are all well studied and do not pose
          known serious threat to human health or the environment. In addition, our engineered E. coli has been designed
          safety modules that allow users to actively kill the E. coli any time. What’s more, to prevent pollution of
          the environment, we designed E. coli that unable to live without the human body. When they escape the human
          body, they will trigger a kill switch and be killed at once. All our experiments are carried out in strict
          regulation with disinfection and sterilization procedures to prevent the escape. Seeing the module safety
          section for details.

          The safety manager of our laboratory is Wang Bo, who is also the manager of many laboratories in the school.
          He has many years of laboratory management experience and can do a good job in safety management. Our
          laboratory also has a complete attendance registration system, which can quickly determine the responsible
          person after finding any problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          The laboratory is equipped with emergency sprinklers, eye washers, fume hoods and other devices to ensure our
          safety. Our laboratory also has perfect safety emergency facilities, which meet the safety protection
          requirements of biosafety level 1 laboratory.

        Degradation of Cas9 at a proper rate
        In order to verify the function of Clb2 (N124aa) as a degradation tag, we constructed the plasmids for an
        experimental and a control group. We hoped to characterize the protein degradation by determining the
        fluorescence intensity curve.
        1.The two plasmids were constructed with pYES2, containing GAL1 galactose inducible promoter and URA3 marker
        gene. The vector in the experimental group contains CLB2 (N124aa)- Linker-GFP, while the control group only
        contains GFP. The successfully constructed vectors were transformed into E.coli DH5α strain.
        2.After the plasmids were extracted and linearized, they were transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae
        BY4741. We used the fluorescence microscope and differential interference microscope to verify the
        transformants.
        3.Both experimental and control groups were cultured in SC medium at 30 ℃ until OD600 value reached about
        3.000, and then the expression was induced by galactose with a final concentration of 2%. After induction,
        the fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry at half an hour interval.
        4.Cells were then inoculated into the medium containing glucose instead of galactose. In addition to being a
        carbon source, glucose also inhibits the expression of GFP by inhibiting the GAL1 promoter. Within 7 hours
        after inoculation, the fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry at the same interval of half an
        hour.
        5.We used SPSS26.0 to process the data and determined the relationship between fluorescence intensity and
        time, as well as the protein concentration and time. Finally, we calculated the degradation rate of protein
        modified by Clb2 N124aa through modeling.
